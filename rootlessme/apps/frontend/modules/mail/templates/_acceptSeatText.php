Hi <?php echo $reader->getFirstName(); ?>,

<?php echo $otherUser->getFullName(); ?> has accepted the terms from <?php echo $seat->getRoutes()->getOriginString(); ?> to <?php echo $seat->getRoutes()->getDestinationString(); ?> on <?php echo $seat->getPickupDate(); ?> at <?php echo $seat->getPickupTime(); ?>!

You can view the terms at %LINK%

Now that your terms have been accepted, what next?

Make sure to contact the person with any remaining questions you may have. You may want to contact the person on their phone to arrange the final details.

Thanks for using Rootless,

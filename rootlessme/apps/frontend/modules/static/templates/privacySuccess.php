    <p>
        We are a new company, just a few people sitting around our computers
        trying to change the way people travel. As a result we do not have
        a privacy policy. All of the information you enter into our site is
        public for now. We have plans for privacy features, but as of
        right now they are not available. Sorry for the inconvenience. We
        value privacy and always strive to respect our users. Unfortunately,
        we do not have the privacy features in place yet.
    </p>

        Please send us an email at contact@rootless.me with your concerns
        and privacy requirements! We love hearing from people.

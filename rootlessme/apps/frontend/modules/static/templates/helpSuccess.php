        We want to make sharing rides easy. Please check out the topics below,
        but if you still have questions please email us at contact@rootless.me
        and we will answer your question.
    </p>
    <br/>

    <span id="footerSignature">1.) How much of my information is public on Rootless.me?</span><br/>
    <p>
        As of right now, all information posted under the ‘Profile’ section is 
        visible to all users. The information you enter in your Settings will 
        denote if it is public or private. We hope to roll out some more privacy 
        settings in the near future.
    </p><br/><br/>
        <span id="footerSignature">2.) I have a driver's license, but I'm not 18 yet. Can I still participate on Rootless.me?</span><br/>
    <p>
        You must be 18 years or older to use Rootless.me.  On your 18th birthday, 
        we will be thrilled for you to get started with the rootless community!
    </p><br/><br/>
            <span id="footerSignature">3.) Trips which begin and end in spots I am not going show up when I search for rides, why is this?</span><br/>
    <p>
        The Rootless.me ride system is designed in a way to allow drivers to pick 
        up passengers along their route. Let’s say you are driving from Ohio to 
        Florida and someone in Georgia needs a ride to Florida as well. Since you 
        will be passing them on your way, why not pick them up?! 
    </p><br/><br/>
            <span id="footerSignature">4.) Can I donate to Rootless.me?</span><br/>
    <p>
        As of right now, no. We are currently in beta mode, but hopefully in 
        the near future you can give to support this grassroots site!
        If you are interested in investment opportunities, please email Business@rootless.me
    </p><br/><br/>
            <span id="footerSignature">5.) I would like to delete my account from the site, how do I do that?</span><br/>
    <p>
        If you need to delete your account, please email us at help@rootless.me We will be 
        rolling out a feature to delete your own account in the near future.
    </p><br/><br/>
            <span id="footerSignature">6.) I have suggestions for the site. Where should I send them?</span><br/>
    <p>
        Send us an email at 
        feedback@rootless.me . You will find all of our contact information 
        on our Contact Us page. We love to hear from you!
    </p><br/><br/>
            <span id="footerSignature">7.) Someone is harassing me through Rootless.me, what should I do?</span><br/>
    <p>
        Please send us a detailed description of the situation to support@rootless.me 
        if you are being harassed by another member on the site.  We take this 
        very seriously and will promptly take appropriate action. 
    </p><br/><br/>
            <span id="footerSignature">9.) How do I become a verified student?</span><br/>
    <p>
        You become verified student by registering with the site using your .edu email 
        address from your college or university.  If you registered with a different 
        email, you can change this in your Settings to become a verified student.
    </p><br/><br/>
            <span id="footerSignature">10.) How do I become a verified user?</span><br/>
    <p>
        You can become a verified member by following a few easy steps.  You first supply 
        us with your home address and a money donation.  Once we receive an authorized 
        donation from you, we will send a postcard to the supplied address.  You will 
        send the postcard back to us, so that we can verify your address.  Once this 
        is complete, other members of the site will see that you are a verified member.  
        Start the verification process here!

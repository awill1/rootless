        Rootless.me was an idea we came up with one summer not too long ago. 
        With gas prices high and a large population of young adults without cars, 
        we decided it was time to change the way people travel. There are so many 
        empty seats on the road and no real reason for it to be that way. Our solution is Rootless.me.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        We started off as 3 design students at the University of Cincinnati, but quickly realized in 
        order to get this idea off the ground we would really need some developers. We grew our 
        operation to 5, and that is what we are today.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Really, Rootless.me is all about meeting people. It doesn't matter who you are or where 
        you're from, you can share the road with someone else and hopefully learn something along 
        the way. We want to use the Internet as a way to bring people closer together and interact 
        in person, not just a place for looking at silly cat pictures (but we do that too).
        <br/>
